1. Browser sends a GET request to the above URL

2. Server receives request and sends back the HTML page

3. Browser will render HTML page accordingly
3.1. Browser encounters the link tag (css) and sends a GET request to exampleapp/main.css -- server sends back the css file
3.2. Browser encounters the script tag (js) and sends a GET request to exampleapp/main.js -- server sends back the js file

4. The script gets executed by the browser, the js file is sending out a GET request to /exampleapp/data.json for the notes -- server sends back json note data
5. The notes then get appended via the DOM API to the HTML page and then finishes rendering the page

//// Creating a new note on https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/notes

1. The form submit action is a POST request to https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note
1.1 new_note pushes the note onto the notes array 

2. The server response is a 302 redirect to /exampleapp/notes

3. Because of the redirect the browser now goes through the whole above cycle again (GET request) when visiting /exampleapp/notes URL-
   and thus has access to the new notes

2. Server response to said request is the HTML page

3. Browser will render HTML page accordingly
3.1. Browser encounters the link tag (css) and sends a GET request to exampleapp/main.css -- server sends back the css file
3.2. Browser encounters the script tag (js) and sends a GET request to exampleapp/spa.js -- server sends back the js file

4. Again the script gets executed by the browser

     after which redrawNotes run to append said notes in an li tag to the unordered list
4.2. window.onload runs at the end of the document loading process --> causing redrawNotes to be run again --> end of loading document
